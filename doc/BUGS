The list is probably not as scary as it once was.
Anyone with some free time is welcome to fix those =)

* chkconf shows wrong line numbers (and sometimes wrong filenames) when M4
  is used.

* sometimes dual stack (v4/v6) servers do not want to connect to uplinks.
  it seems that somehow they try to connect to v4 from v6 source ip and fail.
